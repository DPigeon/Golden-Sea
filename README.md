A variation of Oxygen Fight that I made before: a 3D game made with Unity.

### Compile & Run

The game can be compiled while editing and saving a C# file and running the MainMenu scene. It can then be run by pressing the Play
button on Unity scene.

### Play

You can play the game by pressing the Play button on the Unity window of the MainMenu scene file. Then, the player chooses between
2 modes: Normal Mode and Special Mode. In both modes, the goal is to get as many points as possible by collecting golden items and
bringing them to the boat at the top. Two lives are generated after each completion of a level and a special sound is made after leveling up. 
You may use the space bar to swim around by tapping it and your mouse to move in other directions. The special mode allows you to obtain a 
golden nitro tank. Its power is that it will make you swim very fast in the direction you want for 3 seconds when the 'X' key is pressed. The
player can also throw shiny figurines at fishes to distract them by pressing 'C'. In addition, the 'Q' key is used to pause the game if needed.
Finally, the 'Z' key is used to toggle on/off the 3rd person view to see behind your character if needed by keeping it pressed.
